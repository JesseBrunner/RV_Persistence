# Empirical estimates of persistence times
PersistenceTimes.Rmd # Code for creating figure 2.
PersistenceTimes.csv # Data from published and unpublished estimates of persistence times, usually provided as T90 times.
Persistence_ATV_ASU2002.csv # Unpublished data referenced in Brunner, J.L., Schock, D.M. & Collins, J.P. (2007) Transmission dynamics of the amphibian ranavirus Ambystoma tigrinum virus. Diseases of Aquatic Organisms, 77, 87-95. This experiment involved spiking aged tap water or pond water with the ranavirus, _Ambystoma tigrinum_ virus.
